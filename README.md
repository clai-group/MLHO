MLHO (pronounced as melo) is a thinkin’ Machine Learning framework that
implements iterative sequential representation mining, and feature and
model selection to predict health outcomes.

## Installation

You can install the released version of mlho from
[Github](https://github.com/clai-group/MLHO) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("clai-group/mlho")
```

## Data model

To implement MLHO you’ll need 2 tables, which can be extracted from any
clinical CMD. The current examples are based on the i2b2 star schema.

1- a table with outcome labels (called `labeldt`) and patient numbers

|              |        |
| :----------- | :----- |
| patient\_num | label  |
| character    | factor |

2- a patient clinical data table (called `dbmart`) with 3 columns.
Concepts are used as features by MLHO.

|              |             |           |
| :----------- | :---------- | :-------- |
| patient\_num | start\_date | phenx     |
| character    | date        | character |

The column `phenx` contains the entire feature space. In an `i2b2` data
model, for instance, this column is the equivalent of `concept_cd`.

3- a demographic table is optional, but recommended.

|              |           |           |           |
| :----------- | :-------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| patient\_num | age       | gender    | …         |
| character    | character | character | character |
